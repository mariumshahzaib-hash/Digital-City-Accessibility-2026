What My Code Does
My code operates an automated hospital triage system that evaluates patients based on their pain levels (rated 1-10). The system categorizes patients into different priority levels: critical cases (pain 8-10) are sent immediately to the emergency room, urgent cases (pain 5-7) are scheduled to see a doctor within 30 minutes, and routine cases (pain 1-4) receive regular appointment scheduling. This ensures patients receive care based on the severity of their condition.
Who It Helps
This code helps emergency room patients experiencing severe pain or life-threatening conditions, patients with moderate injuries or illnesses who need timely medical attention, people with minor health concerns who can wait for scheduled appointments, and hospital staff including nurses, doctors, and triage coordinators who need to prioritize care efficiently.
How It Makes the City Accessible
Before this code, hospital triage relied entirely on manual assessment, which could lead to delays, human error during busy periods, and inconsistent prioritization of patients. Now the system provides immediate, standardized evaluation that ensures critical patients receive emergency care without delay, while also preventing the emergency room from being overwhelmed by non-urgent cases. This automation saves lives by guaranteeing that the sickest patients are seen first, reduces wait times for everyone, and helps medical staff make faster, data-driven decisions about patient care. It makes healthcare more accessible by ensuring fair, consistent treatment for all patients regardless of when they arrive.
