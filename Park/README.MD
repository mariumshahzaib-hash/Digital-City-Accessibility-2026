What My Code Does

My code controls the park wheelchair ramp system by monitoring weight sensors. When someone weighing 10 kg or more approaches the ramp, the system automatically detects their presence and deploys a safe, accessible ramp for entry. If the weight is below 10 kg, the system stays in standby mode to conserve energy.

Who It Helps

This code helps wheelchair users, elderly visitors with mobility aids like walkers or scooters, parents pushing strollers, and anyone using assistive mobility devices. It specifically benefits people who need physical access assistance but want to maintain their independence when visiting the park.Automated Park Ramp System


How It Makes the City Accessible

Before this code, wheelchair users and people with mobility challenges had to wait for assistance or find alternative entrances to access the park, which limited their independence and spontaneous visits. Now they can enter the park safely and independently at any time without needing to ask staff for help. This automation removes barriers and ensures equal access to public recreational spaces, making the park truly inclusive for all community members regardless of their physical abilities.
