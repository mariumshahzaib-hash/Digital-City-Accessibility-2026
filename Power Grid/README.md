Project Overview

The Automated Power Grid Light Sensor System is designed to intelligently control a city’s street lighting infrastructure based on real-time environmental light conditions. Instead of relying on traditional fixed timers, this system dynamically adjusts street light brightness to improve public safety, reduce energy consumption, and ensure reliable operation across the city.

What My Code Does

This system continuously monitors ambient light levels using a sensor that operates on a 0–100 scale and automatically adjusts street lights according to the detected conditions:

When the light level is below 30, the street lights turn fully ON to ensure maximum visibility.

When the light level is between 30 and 69, the lights operate at 50 percent brightness to balance safety and energy efficiency.

When the light level is between 70 and 100, the street lights turn OFF because natural daylight is sufficient.

The code also includes advanced error handling to prevent system crashes caused by invalid inputs, sensor failures, or potential sabotage attempts. This protection ensures the stability and reliability of the power grid.

Who It Helps

This system supports a wide range of people within the city, including:

City residents who need safe and well-lit streets for walking at night.

Drivers who depend on proper street lighting for road visibility and accident prevention.

Elderly people and children who are more vulnerable in poorly lit areas.

City utility and maintenance workers responsible for managing the power grid.

Taxpayers, by reducing unnecessary electricity usage and maintenance costs.

How It Makes the City More Accessible

Before this system was implemented, street lights operated on fixed schedules that did not respond to actual lighting conditions. This resulted in wasted electricity during bright days and unsafe darkness during early evenings, winter seasons, or bad weather.

With this automated solution, street lighting now adapts instantly to real-time conditions. Streets remain consistently and safely illuminated while conserving energy whenever possible. The built-in error handling protects the power grid from complete shutdowns that could leave neighborhoods in darkness due to technical faults or malicious interference.

This system improves city accessibility by providing reliable lighting for people with vision impairments, creating safer pedestrian environments, and ensuring that emergency services can navigate streets efficiently at any time. It removes the barrier of unpredictable or inadequate street lighting that previously made many residents feel unsafe after dark.
